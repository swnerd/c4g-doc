Enhancements have been done over the subsequent time period, including the local repository mode. The central repository integration with Conductor for Gluent frontend was done in 2019. Standalone No additional software is needed or required. The software just provides a consistent job-oriented method for running gluent offloads. Jobs are setup through flat \"job\" files. Scheduling of the individual jobs requires a cron entry per job. Standalone with local repository Same as standalone. Additionally, some result information is stored in tables under the gluent_adm schema, such as, tables offloaded, job success, when possible some information on bytes transferred. Full Conductor for Gluent with Central Repository Jobs are configured and scheduled through the front-end software. A single cron job is required to handle the launching of jobs based on schedule in the central repository. All information gathered about the job success, partitions offloaded, etc is stored in the central repository. Prerequisites Gluent Software Installed Cloudera with Impala only parquet-tools available in the path of the edge node for the ssh user when using Full Conductor for Gluent Front-end and Back-end with Central Repository - usually found in /var/lib/alternatives. Central Repository Database Installed (see C4G Frontend Setup Guide) Unpack Software A tar file will be supplied. The tar file should be unpacked in a directory such as, c4g-scripts or scripts or similar. For example: cd /u01/app/gluent mkdir c4g-scripts cd c4g-scripts tar xf {tar file name} Environment File Setup Note on split configuration : If gluent is setup in a split configuration, then certain scripts will not function, and certain variables are not set in the environment files. conductor_for_gluent.env A template for the conductor_for_gluent.env file can be found under the env/templates directory - it is recommended that you copy the template file as a starting point. PATH - This export of the path is to make sure the oraenv script is in the path. ORACLE_SID - Set this to the Oracle SID of the database which is being offloaded. ORAENV_ASK - Set for no prompts. oraenv - script to set the oracle environment. Unset ORAENV_ASK As this shell script runs SQL, the SQL_PATH variable is unset, so as not to get possible interference (same name scripts, login.sql files, etc). OFFLOAD_HOME=\"/u01/app/gluent/offload\" - Update OFFLOAD_HOME to the location of the gluent software offload home. . $OFFLOAD_HOME/conf/offload.env - DO NOT CHANGE C4G_REPO NONE - No Repository; standalone mode without a repository RUNTIME- run a local repository that stores information generated a runtime FULL - run a central repository that stores information about jobs, schedules, etc. HADOOP_HOST - defaults to the HDFS_CMD_HOST HADOOP_SSH_USER - set to the target user on hadoop for ssh G_ERROR_WORDS - Words and phrases used when determining if a possible error occurred. TNS_ADMIN - Always set to ${tnsdir} - DO NOT CHANGE AEG_GLUENT_REPO_SERVICE - service name to be used when connecting to the central repository AEG_GLUENT_LOCAL_SERVICE - service name to be used when connecting to the local database dstr - service name used in local repository and standalone mode impala_node - automatically determined but can be overridden IMPALA_SHELL_CMD - command with options need to run impala-shell run-gluent-job.env A template for the file can be found under the env/templates directory - it is recommended that you copy the template file as a starting point. PRECREATED_DBS - true or false (defaults to false) Only add/update if gluent is not allowed to create databases on impala G_BEGIN_NOTIFY - true or false G_BEGIN_MAIL_LIST - email addresses space separated in quotes. G_SUCCESS_NOTIFY - true or false G_SUCCESS_MAIL_LIST - email addresses space separated in quotes. G_ERROR_NOTIFY -true or false G_ERROR_MAIL_LIST - email addresses space separated in quotes. setup-wallet.env A template for the file can be found under the env/templates directory - it is recommended that you copy the template file as a starting point. AEG_WALLET_LOCATION=/u01/app/gluent/scripts/tns - update to the location to contain the wallet WALLET_ENTRY - the wallet entry you want to setup (corresponds to a TNS service name) Configuration File Setup If not running in the Central Repository mode, then 2 configuration files can be created to set default offload and present parameters. offload-defaults.cfg present-defaults.cfg User Setup in Local Database for Central Repository Mode A user is needed in the local database with the following username: CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT create user conductor_for_gluent identified by \"{complex password}\" default tablespace users temporary tablespace temp; The privileges needed are: GRANT CONNECT TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT GLUENT_OFFLOAD_ROLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; -- Needed for Conductor for Gluent to do partition maintenance GRANT DROP ANY TABLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT ALTER ANY TABLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; An alternative to the ANY TABLE privilege is to preform the grant(s) on the tables to be offloaded. TNS Setup This is needed for all 3 modes of the backend software. TNSNAMES.ORA A TNSNAMES.ORA file needs to be created in the tns subdirectory. For the no repository option or the local repository option, one entry for the local DB being offloaded is needed. For the central repository mode, two entries are needed: one for local DB and a second for the central repository. Suggested names are as follows: c4g_local c4g_central Historically, the tns entry was: gluent_conn A sample file is located under the tns/sample directory, showing a simple tns entry. Wallet Setup For Full Conductor for Gluent, run the following: ./setup-wallet new c4g_local ./setup-wallet add c4g_central For Standalone or Runtime Repository modes, run the following: ./setup-wallet new gluent_conn Crontab Setup Once the backend and frontend software are installed, add a cron entry to run the launch script. The job should be like the following with the appropriate path specified: * * * * * /u01/app/gluent/scripts/bin/launch-gluent-jobs {DB/Container Name} /u01/app/gluent/scripts/log/launch-gluent-jobs-cron.log 2 1 Appendix A - xdbconfig_anonymous.sql DECLARE l_configxml XMLTYPE; l_value VARCHAR2(5) := 'true'; BEGIN l_configxml := DBMS_XDB.cfg_get(); IF l_configxml.existsNode('/xdbconfig/sysconfig/protocolconfig/httpconfig/allow-repository-anonymous-access') = 0 THEN -- Add config element begin SELECT insertChildXML( l_configxml , '/xdbconfig/sysconfig/protocolconfig/httpconfig' , 'allow-repository-anonymous-access' , XMLType(' allow-repository-anonymous-access xmlns=\"http://xmlns.oracle.com/xdb/xdbconfig.xsd\" ' || l_value || ' /allow-repository-anonymous-access ') , 'xmlns=\"http://xmlns.oracle.com/xdb/xdbconfig.xsd\"' ) INTO l_configxml FROM dual; exception when others then dbms_output.put_line( 'insert' ); -- ' raise; end; DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('xdbconfig for anonymous now inserted.'); ELSE -- Update existing config element. begin SELECT updateXML( DBMS_XDB.cfg_get() , '/xdbconfig/sysconfig/protocolconfig/httpconfig/allow-repository-anonymous-access/text()' , XMLType(' allow-repository-anonymous-access xmlns=\"http://xmlns.oracle.com/xdb/xdbconfig.xsd\" ' || l_value || ' /allow-repository-anonymous-access ') , 'xmlns=\"http://xmlns.oracle.com/xdb/xdbconfig.xsd\"' ) INTO l_configxml FROM dual; exception when others then dbms_output.put_line( 'update'); -- ' raise; end; DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('xdbconfig for anonymous now updated.'); END IF; DBMS_XDB.cfg_update(l_configxml); DBMS_XDB.cfg_refresh; END; /","title":"Installation"},{"location":"2.2.x/install-2.2.x/#front-end-installation","text":"The frontend installation should be done anytime the central Conductor for Gluent repository will be used along with the Conductor for Gluent Apex application.

The Gluent software works on a per database basis. Conductor has an additional unit above a database called a site. A particular installation of Conductor will have one site with one or more databases to manage. Login Enter the Conductor for Gluent Apex URL into your browser. The URL will be something of the form: http://{hostname}:{port}/apex/f?p=100 Once the Conductor for Gluent login form is available, then enter your username and password for Conductor for Gluent. Site For Conductor, a site is made up of multiple databases. Site Home Page From the site home: You can manage site level options: Default Offload Parameters Default Present Parameters Site Level Notification Options Application Defaults Review metrics at the site level: Job Metrics Amount of Data Offloaded Amount of Space that hasn't been selected from the Gluent Advisor Report Add a New Database - Click on the Add New card from the list. Select a Database to Manage - Click on one of the database cards, to manage it's jobs and tables. Edit the details of a database - Click on the Edit Link of a database to change it's description, icon color, database link information, etc. Site Level Offload Parameters Parameters listed here will be used for every offload command executed across all the databases. Any common or offload type parameter can be added; however, there are few parameters that you would want to apply to all of your offloads. The only example that I have come across was the use of the parameter \"--count-star-expression\". Site Level Present Parameters Parameters listed here will be used for every present command across all the databases. Any common or present type parameter can be added; however, there are few parameters that you would want to apply to all of your present commands. Site Level Notifications Options The implementation of notifications is different than that of parameters. For notifications, the job notifications override the database notifications which override the site notifications. Values entered at the site level will be used when there are no notifications at the database level and at the job level. Notifications are sent at the following points of a job: When Job Begins When Job Succeeds When Job has an Error Notifications can be enabled and disabled. Site Level Application Defaults The application defaults are parameters that affect the way the Conductor for Gluent functions. Here is a list of the parameters and how they work: JOB_LAUNCH_INTERVAL \u2013 Controls the granularity of the drop down for minutes in the job scheduler. If set to 1, you can specify any minute of the hour (0-59). If you specify 15, you can specify 0, 15, 30, 45. OFFLOAD_DROP_RATIO \u2013 Controls the default value for the DROP_THRESHOLD on tables. The value in this field will be multiplied with the OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD to determine the default for the DROP_THRESHOLD. CREATE_HADOOP_DB \u2013 Controls whether the parameter \u2013create-hadoop-db will be included on offload commands. If the Hadoop cluster allows the gluent user to create databases, then it should be set to YES. If the Hadoop cluster does not allow the gluent user to create databases, then set to NO. OFFLOAD_DROP_ACTION \u2013 This is the site-wide default for whether an offload job step should attempt to GENERATE : Generate a script to drop the offloaded partitions after an offload is completed based on Drop Threshold. AUTO : Drop the offloaded partitions after a table is offload based on Drop Threshold. MANUAL : Do Nothing after offload is completed. The OFFLOAD_DROP_ACTION can be over-ridden at the table level. Add/Edit Database The database name, description and connection method can be specified on this screen. Then press Add button. To update the database link information (if that is being used), is done by pressing on the DB Link Wizard button. DB Link Wizard \u2013 Step 1 Enter the host name, port, service name, and password. Press Next to create the database link. DB Link Wizard \u2013 Step 2 Press Test DB Link to verify that the database link is correct. Press Finish if the test is successful. Press the left arrow to go back and correct any of the database link information. Database Database Home Page After clicking on a database on the Site Home, you will go to the database home page for that particular database. At the top of the screen are buttons/links to set offload, present and notification parameters at the database level Followed by some summary information about the database: Advisor Candidates \u2013 # of tables in the advisor report that have not been selected for offload. Select Tables \u2013 # of tables that have been selected as candidates for offload. Total Jobs \u2013 # of jobs that have been created. Running Jobs \u2013 # of jobs currently running. Successful Jobs \u2013 # of jobs that completed successfully. Jobs in Error State \u2013 # of jobs where an error has occurred. Below you will find metrics at the database level for the selected database: Job Metrics Amount of Data Offloaded Amount of Space that hasn't been selected from the Gluent Advisor Report From this page, the menu options expand to include access to: Dashboard Job Maintenance Table Review Candidate Selection DB Level Offload Parameters Parameters listed here will be used for every offload command executed for this database. Any common or offload type parameter can be added; however, there are few parameters that you would want to apply to all of your database offloads. DB Level Present Parameters Parameters listed here will be used for every present command executed for this database. Any common or present type parameter can be added; however, there are few parameters that you would want to apply to all of your database present commands. DB Level Notifications Options The implementation of notifications is different than that of parameters. For notifications, the job notifications override the database notifications which override the site notifications. Values entered at the database level will be used when there are no notifications at the job level. Notifications are sent at the following points of a job: When Job Begins When Job Succeeds When Job has an Error Notifications can be enabled and disabled. Tables Candidate Selection Wizard Step 1 \u2013 Select an Advisor Output File : Select a file or if this is your second time through, you can use the existing file. Multiple files can be uploaded if a new advisor report CSV is obtained. Press Next to continue. Step 2 \u2013 Select Tables : Select one or more tables that you want to offload. Press Next to continue. Step 3 \u2013 Table Thresholds : The default offload threshold will be determined from the Advisor report. The drop threshold default will be calculated using the application parameter OFFLOAD_DROP_RATIO * offload threshold. Either threshold may be updated if desired. Press Next to continue. Step 4 \u2013 Partition Details : If a database link is in use, then the partition details will be automatically loaded from the database into the repository. If no connection is available, the partition details will need to be entered manually. Additionally, a column mask can be selected for numbers or strings that represent dates. Press Finish to complete the wizard. Table Review The table review screen allows you to add a new table and view information about the tables that have been selected to offload. The following details about tables are available: For all tables, you can: View and Update table level offload parameters Review the Oracle Offload Datasets Review the Hadoop Offload Datasets Additionally, for partitioned tables, you can: View and update the partition details View and update the offload and drop threshold, as well as, the offload drop action. Add Table Wizard To add a new table, click the Add Table Wizard button. When a database link is allowed, the first screen of the Add Table Wizard will have select lists for the schemas and table names. When next is hit, the partitioning information will be automatically gathered. When no connection is allowed, you will need to manually enter the correct schema, table_name and partitioning type. The second screen of the Add Table Wizard will be used to specify the Offload and Drop Thresholds for partition tables. No information is entered for non-partitioned tables. The third screen of the Add Table Wizard is used to specify the partition keys when no connection is allowed. Plus, date masking can be specified for cases where a string or number is used to represent a date. No information is entered for non-partitioned tables. Jobs Job Maintenance Main Screen The main screen for job maintenance contains cards, each with a job on it. Jobs can be selected by clicking on the card. Clicking on the current card allows the editing of details about the job. The job steps are editable in this screen. The Job Add Wizard and calendar view are available by pressing the corresponding buttons. Jobs - Duplicate Table Job Configuration When there are duplicate copies of tables that need to be offloaded in multiple schemas. An example of this would be if a company had a schema per client with the same tables under each schema. A Duplicate Table Job is added through the Add Job Wizard , however, only step 1 is entered. After completing step 1, you will be taken back to the main job maintenance screen. Once you select the job, you can start adding elements to the configuration. The different types of elements in a configuration are: Duplicate Enter duplicate table details. Only a table name is specified (no schema/owner), as there are multiple duplicate tables across the database The duplicate element will look for the specified table name across all schemas in the database. Include Enter the details for a specific table that should be included in the job. Enter a full table name with owner/schema and table names specified. Exclude Enter the details for a specific table that should be excluded in the job. Enter a full table name with owner/schema and table names specified. Example A call center company has one schema for each client that they service through their call center. Under each of those client schemas, they have a CALL_DETAILS table which needs to be offload. In addition, they have a training schema, which has a CALL_DETAILS table that should not be offloaded. The configuration elements for this scenario are: Duplicate, CALL_DETAILS Exclude, TRAINING.CALL_DETAILS This will result in a job being geneated based on the frequency desired that will have all of the CALL_DETAILS tables except the one from the TRAINING schema. Add Job Wizard Step 1: Job Name and Type The job name can be any alpha-numeric characters. The job description is a free form field. The job type is going to be Normal most of the time. Press Next to continue. Note: A rare case calls for a Duplicate Table job type, when there are duplicate copies of tables that need to be offloaded in multiple schemas. An example of this would be if a company had a schema per client with the same tables under each schema. A Duplicate Table job does not have defined steps. This job type will be covered in a separate section. Step 2: Job Steps Select the step type. Then select the table for the step. Select if the step is enabled or disabled. All steps also have a step comment. Other fields will depend on the step type. Press Next to continue. Step 3: Job Schedule Jobs can be scheduled on a Monthly, Weekly, Daily, or Hourly basis. With each, you must select the appropriate details: Monthly \u2013 day of the month (1-28), hour and minute Weekly \u2013 day of the week, hour and minute Daily \u2013 hour and minute Hourly \u2013 minute Only jobs with complete information can be enabled. Jobs - Future Calendar Based on the job scheduling information that has been entered, you can view when jobs will run to help see when there might be conflicts with a maintenance outage or too many jobs running at once. Dashboard The dashboard allows for monitoring of running jobs and shows some statistics on offloaded tables. Job States The donut graph shows a summary by state of the jobs. The state pieces can be clicked on to drill down into the details. Recent Jobs The 10 most recent jobs. Drilldown to the Current Run of the Job, by clicking on the ID. Also, the job name can be selected to drill down to the job details. Bytes Comparison Bytes used in Impala versus the bytes used in Oracle Space Recovery In orange is the amount of space that could be recovered if data was truncated/dropped from the offload partitions. In red, we have the amount of data that was truncated/dropped from oracle after offload.","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"2.2.x/user-guide-2.2.x/#introduction","text":"Conductor for Gluent is an application to help manage Gluent offloads.

Enhancements have been done over the subsequent time period, including the local repository mode. The central repository integration with Conductor for Gluent frontend was done in 2019. Standalone No additional software is needed or required. The software just provides a consistent job-oriented method for running gluent offloads. Jobs are setup through flat \"job\" files. Scheduling of the individual jobs requires a cron entry per job. Standalone with local repository Same as standalone. Additionally, some result information is stored in tables under the gluent_adm schema, such as, tables offloaded, job success, when possible some information on bytes transferred. Full Conductor for Gluent with Central Repository Jobs are configured and scheduled through the front-end software. A single cron job is required to handle the launching of jobs based on schedule in the central repository. All information gathered about the job success, partitions offloaded, etc is stored in the central repository. Prerequisites Gluent Data Platform 4.1.0+ Installed Central Repository Database Installed (see C4G Frontend Setup Guide) Unpack Software A tar file will be supplied. The tar file should be unpacked in a directory such as, c4g-scripts or scripts or similar. For example: cd /u01/app/gluent mkdir c4g-scripts cd c4g-scripts tar xf {tar file name} Environment File Setup Note on split configuration : If gluent is setup in a split configuration, then certain scripts will not function, and certain variables are not set in the environment files. conductor_for_gluent.env A template for the conductor_for_gluent.env file can be found under the env/templates directory - it is recommended that you copy the template file as a starting point. PATH - This export of the path is to make sure the oraenv script is in the path. ORACLE_SID - Set this to the Oracle SID of the database which is being offloaded. ORAENV_ASK - Set for no prompts. oraenv - script to set the oracle environment. Unset ORAENV_ASK As this shell script runs SQL, the SQL_PATH variable is unset, so as not to get possible interference (same name scripts, login.sql files, etc). OFFLOAD_HOME=\"/u01/app/gluent/offload\" - Update OFFLOAD_HOME to the location of the gluent software offload home. . $OFFLOAD_HOME/conf/offload.env - DO NOT CHANGE C4G_REPO NONE - No Repository; standalone mode without a repository RUNTIME- run a local repository that stores information generated a runtime FULL - run a central repository that stores information about jobs, schedules, etc. G_ERROR_WORDS - Words and phrases used when determining if a possible error occurred. TNS_ADMIN - Always set to ${tnsdir} - DO NOT CHANGE AEG_GLUENT_REPO_SERVICE - service name to be used when connecting to the central repository AEG_GLUENT_LOCAL_SERVICE - service name to be used when connecting to the local database dstr - service name used in local repository and standalone mode run-gluent-job.env A template for the file can be found under the env/templates directory - it is recommended that you copy the template file as a starting point. PRECREATED_DBS - true or false (defaults to false) Only add/update if gluent is not allowed to create databases on impala G_BEGIN_NOTIFY - true or false G_BEGIN_MAIL_LIST - email addresses space separated in quotes. G_SUCCESS_NOTIFY - true or false G_SUCCESS_MAIL_LIST - email addresses space separated in quotes. G_ERROR_NOTIFY -true or false G_ERROR_MAIL_LIST - email addresses space separated in quotes. setup-wallet.env A template for the file can be found under the env/templates directory - it is recommended that you copy the template file as a starting point. AEG_WALLET_LOCATION=/u01/app/gluent/scripts/tns - update to the location to contain the wallet Configuration File Setup If not running in the Central Repository mode, then 2 configuration files can be created to set default offload and present parameters. offload-defaults.cfg present-defaults.cfg User Setup in Local Database for Central Repository Mode A user is needed in the local database with the following username: CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT create user conductor_for_gluent identified by \"{complex password}\" default tablespace users temporary tablespace temp; The privileges needed are: GRANT CONNECT TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT GLUENT_OFFLOAD_ROLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; -- Needed for Conductor for Gluent to do partition maintenance GRANT DROP ANY TABLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; GRANT ALTER ANY TABLE TO CONDUCTOR_FOR_GLUENT; An alternative to the ANY TABLE privilege is to preform the grant(s) on the tables to be offloaded. TNS Setup This is needed for all 3 modes of the backend software. TNSNAMES.ORA A TNSNAMES.ORA file needs to be created in the tns subdirectory. For the no repository option or the local repository option, one entry for the local DB being offloaded is needed. For the central repository mode, two entries are needed: one for local DB and a second for the central repository. Suggested names are as follows: c4g_local c4g_central Historically, the tns entry was: gluent_conn A sample file is located under the tns/sample directory, showing a simple tns entry. Wallet Setup For Full Conductor for Gluent, run the following: ./setup-wallet new c4g_local ./setup-wallet add c4g_central For Standalone or Runtime Repository modes, run the following: ./setup-wallet new gluent_conn Crontab Setup Once the backend and frontend software are installed, add a cron entry to run the launch script. The job should be like the following with the appropriate path specified: * * * * * /u01/app/gluent/scripts/bin/launch-gluent-jobs {DB/Container Name} /u01/app/gluent/scripts/log/launch-gluent-jobs-cron.log 2 1","title":"Installation"},{"location":"3.0.x/install-3.0.x/#front-end-installation","text":"The frontend installation should be done anytime the central Conductor for Gluent repository will be used along with the Conductor for Gluent Apex application.

Before resuming where it left off, the job will rewrite the job file to pick up any changes to job parameters or other job step information that has been updated. This option would be used in cases where an additional parameter is needed or something else about the job was specified incorrectly. Command Parameters Command parameters are Gluent Data Platform parameters that can be specified to be used by offload or present commands executed by Conductor for Gluent. They can be specified at different levels of operation: Site Level - Parameters will be used for every offload or present command executed across all the databases. Database Level - Parameters will be used for every offload or present command executed for that specific database. Table Level - Parameters will be used for every offload or present command executed for that specific table. Job Step Level - Parameters will be used for every offload or present command executed for that specific job step. In the above example screen, the command parameters are being maintained for offload commands at the site level. Add Command Parameter Here is the flow of adding a parameter. Before adding a parameter to a job step Hit the Add Parameter button. Add Parameter: Initial Screen Click on the dropdown Add Parameter: Dropdown list Select a parameter from the dropdown list. Add Parameter: Specify value If the parameter requires a value, that is entered and then hit Add button. After adding a parameter to a job step Once the parameter is added, it will show up in the report for that job step. Job Notifications The implementation of notifications is different than that of parameters. It is not an accumulation but an override system: Job Level - Job notifications override any notifications at the database or site level. Database Level - Database level notification will be used when their are no notifications set at the job level. Site Level - Values entered at the site level will be used when there are no notifications at the database level and at the job level. Notifications are sent at the following points of a job: When Job Begins When Job Succeeds If Job has an Error Notifications can be enabled and disabled. Fields: Email Addresses for Notifications when Job Begins Enabled toggle for Notifications when Job Begins Email Addresses for Notifications when Job Succeeds Enabled toggle for Notifications when Job Succeeds Email Addresses for Notifications if Job has an Error Enabled toggle for Notifications if Job has an Error Buttons: Close - Close the dialog. Delete - Delete the notifications. Save - Save any changes made to the notifications. Application Defaults The application defaults are parameters that affect the way the Conductor for Gluent functions. Here is a list of the parameters and how they work: CREATE_BACKEND_DB \u2013 Controls whether the parameter \u2013create-backend-db will be included on offload commands. If the backend system allows the gluent user to create databases, then it should be set to YES. If the backend system does not allow the gluent user to create databases, then set to NO. DROP_VERIFY_EXPIRY \u2013 (for future use) DROP_VERIFY_LEVEL \u2013 Controls the default value for the DROP_VERIFY_LEVEL on tables. COUNT : Before dropping a partition perform a count verification of the frontend partition boudaries against the backend and frontend and verify they match before proceeding with a partition drop. TRUST : Trust that no modifications (DML) have been performed on the frontend or backend tables before proceeding with a partition drop. No count will be done. The DROP_VERIFY_LEVEL can be over-ridden at the table level. JOB_LAUNCH_INTERVAL \u2013 Controls the granularity of the drop down for minutes in the job scheduler. If set to 1, you can specify any minute of the hour (0-59). If you specify 15, you can specify 0, 15, 30, 45. OFFLOAD_DROP_RATIO \u2013 Controls the default value for the DROP_THRESHOLD on tables. The value in this field will be multiplied with the OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD to determine the default for the DROP_THRESHOLD. OFFLOAD_DROP_ACTION \u2013 This is the site-wide default for whether an offload job step should attempt to GENERATE : Generate a script to drop the offloaded partitions after an offload is completed based on Drop Threshold. AUTO : Drop the offloaded partitions after a table is offload based on Drop Threshold. MANUAL : Do Nothing after offload is completed. The OFFLOAD_DROP_ACTION can be over-ridden at the table level. Double-click in the Value field to edit the parameter value. Appendix A: Jobs - Duplicate Table Job Configuration When there are duplicate copies of tables that need to be offloaded in multiple schemas. An example of this would be if a company had a schema per client with the same tables under each schema. A Duplicate Table Job is added through the Add Job Wizard , however, only step 1 is entered. After completing step 1, you will be taken back to the main job maintenance page. Once you select the job, you can start adding elements to the configuration. The different types of elements in a configuration are: Duplicate Enter duplicate table details. Only a table name is specified (no schema/owner), as there are multiple duplicate tables across the database The duplicate element will look for the specified table name across all schemas in the database. Include Enter the details for a specific table that should be included in the job. Enter a full table name with owner/schema and table names specified. Exclude Enter the details for a specific table that should be excluded in the job. Enter a full table name with owner/schema and table names specified. Example A call center company has one schema for each client that they service through their call center. Under each of those client schemas, they have a CALL_DETAILS table which needs to be offload. In addition, they have a training schema, which has a CALL_DETAILS table that should not be offloaded. The configuration elements for this scenario are: Duplicate, CALL_DETAILS Exclude, TRAINING.CALL_DETAILS This will result in a job being geneated based on the frequency desired that will have all of the CALL_DETAILS tables except the one from the TRAINING schema.","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"3.0.x/user-guide-3.0.x/#introduction","text":"Conductor for Gluent is an application to help manage Gluent offloads.
