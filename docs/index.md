# Overview
Conductor for Gluent makes managing offloads with Gluent Data Platform easier. The orchestration of tasks such as offload execution, monitoring and partition dropping can be done through a single UI.

Conductor provides global-, database- and job-level parameters for job execution, notifications and partition removal. This drives consistency in the operation of Gluent software across the environment.


# Setting Up

Conductor for Gluent integrates Gluent Advisor findings with existing database information to make offloading candidate tables simple and stress-free. Once defined, jobs can be scheduled to execute offload commands and drop offloaded partitions if desired.

# Managing

Conductor for Gluent’s job status dashboard makes it simple to view failed, completed and executing jobs. Failed jobs can be re-run as required.

Conductor provides a simple way to create and manage jobs via a wizard. Managing existing jobs (removing, changing, deactivating, etc.) is driven solely through the UI.

# Statistics

One of the primary use cases for Gluent Data Platform is offloading data to a cheaper, more modern data platform. Conductor for Gluent captures how much space is offloaded and presents it in a simple, visual display. Centralized reporting on space savings makes tracking this KPI easy.
